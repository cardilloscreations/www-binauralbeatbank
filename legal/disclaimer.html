<p><strong>WARNINGS</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    DO NOT LISTEN to these or any other Binaural Beats when driving, operating machinery, or performing any task that requires your full focus and attention. They affect everyone differently and can induce a meditative state in some people.
  </li>
  <li>
    SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE before listening to these or any other Binaural Beats if you have any conditions that may be triggered in some way (e.g., Epileptic, Seizures, Pregnant, Pacemaker, Mind Altering Drugs).
  </li>
  <li>
    LISTEN AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL so you don't cause ear damage. Louder volume does not increase the effectiveness of brain entrainment.
  </li>
