Peer-reviewed studies have found that listening to 40Hz Binaural Beats before a task can improve focus and concentration. Other studies have documented some benefits from listening to 432Hz sounds. This video combines the two for the benefits of both. See references below.

If 432Hz doesn't resonate with you, visit my channel for alternate versions and find the one that's right for you.

Listen to the entire 15 minutes. Your brain needs at least 5 minutes to synchronize. Most research suggests 15 minutes minimum. Some suggest 30 or 60 minutes, so see instructions below to enable looping if you want to play it longer.

𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐌 :
00:00 40 Hz (432Hz Right Ear / 392Hz Left Ear)

𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐒 & 𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐂𝐋𝐀𝐈𝐌𝐄𝐑 :
See the [WARNINGS & DISCLAIMER](/legal/disclaimer.html) page.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To get the most benefit, listen to the entire program because it takes time for the brain to synchronize.
5. For longer sessions, you can LOOP the video. On a browser, right click on the video and select "Loop" in the overlay that pops up. On mobile, touch the gear icon for the video, then select "Additional Settings" and toggle on the "Loop" setting.
