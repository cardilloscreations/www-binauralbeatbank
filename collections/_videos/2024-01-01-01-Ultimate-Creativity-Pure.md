Coax your brain into a creative state with this program. It combines a 10Hz binaural beat (aka, Alpha waves) with a 432Hz carrier tone (aka "universal frequency"). The 10Hz binaural beats are associated with encouraging creative thought. Likewise, the 432Hz frequency is associated with opening the mind and activating creativity (divergent thinking). Combined, it can be a powerful way to encourage your brain into a creative state.

Listen to the entire 15 minutes. Your brain needs at least 5 minutes to synchronize. Most research suggests 15 minutes minimum. Some suggest 30 or 60 minutes, so see instructions below to enable looping if you want to play it longer.

PURE TONES: This version contains only pure tones, which provide clean binaural beats for optimal brain entrainment. If you prefer a version with light music and ambient waves, which some prefer to help distract the brain, see the alternate version below.

𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To get the most benefit, listen to the entire program because it takes time for the brain to synchronize. Most have unique progressions of carrier tones and beat progressions.
5. For longer sessions, you can LOOP the video. On a browser, right click on the video and select "Loop" in the overlay that pops up. On mobile, touch the gear icon for the video, then select "Additional Settings" and toggle on the "Loop" setting.

A skeptical systematic review, but I like this paper because the author presents the background very well and refers to several interesting studies.
