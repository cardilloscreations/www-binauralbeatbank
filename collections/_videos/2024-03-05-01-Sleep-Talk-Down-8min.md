<p class="premono" markdown="1">
This is a multi-modal sleep talk down that employs several exercises and sound therapies, each powerful on their own, and combined into one super powerful sleep talk down session.

The session starts with sound therapy, using 6Hz (Theta) Binaural Beats via a 174Hz Solfeggio tone in the background along with peaceful music. This encourages the brain to wind down and enter a pre-sleep phase. The session continues with several exercises, phrased using the Milton Model, to melt away stress, induce relaxation, and release neurochemicals in your brain to encourage you to sleep well. See the program notes below for the list of exercises.

Listen to the entire track and try to perform each exercise to the best of your ability. To avoid mid-roll ad disruptions, I condensed this version to be just under 8 minutes.
