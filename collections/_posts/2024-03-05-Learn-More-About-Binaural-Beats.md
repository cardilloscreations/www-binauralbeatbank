      What Are Binaural Beats?
    </h3>
    <section>
      <p>
      Binaural Beats are an auditory illusion perceived by the brain when two <em>different frequencies</em> are heard by each ear simultaneously. The brain perceives hearing a new phantom sound which is the difference between the two frequencies. This phantom sound is called a Binaural Beat.
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, if a 220 Hz tone is played in the right ear, while a 226 Hz tone is played in the left ear, the brain will hear a 6 Hz binaural beat.

      What is Brain Entrainment?
    </h3>
    <section>
      <p>
      Brain Entrainment, also known as brainwave synchronization or neural entrainment, occurs when the brain synchronizes with external stimulus.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many studies have shown that the brain synchronizes with Binaural Beats after about 5-10 minutes.

      How Do Binaural Beats Work?
    </h3>
    <section>
      <p>
      Using electroencephalograms (EEGs), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,10&as_vis=1&q=%22binaural+beats%22&scisbd=1" target="_blank">researchers</a> have mapped out brainwave frequencies (e.g., Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta) that are associated with various mental states.
      The theory is that by inducing entrainment, the brain will be encouraged to enter into the same mental state as the brainwaves observed in those mental states.
      </p>
      <p>
      Using this technique, some studies have show that Binaural Beats can help with pain relief, stress relief, focus, creativity, and more.
