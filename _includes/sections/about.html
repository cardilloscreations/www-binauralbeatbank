      What Are Binaural Beats?
    </h3>
    <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}">
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/binaural-beats" target="_blank">Binaural Beats</a> are heard in your brain when two <em>different tones</em> are played into <em>each ear</em>.
      Your brain hears the difference between the frequencies as a Binaural Beat.
      The beat is phantom because it is not in the audio if you listen to each ear separately.

      What Do They Do?
    </h3>
    <blockquote cite="{{ site.url }}">
      Using electroencephalograms (EEGs), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,10&as_vis=1&q=%22binaural+beats%22&scisbd=1" target="_blank">researchers</a>
      have mapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://neurofeedbackalliance.org/understanding-brain-waves/" target="_blank">brainwaves</a> (e.g., Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta) associated with various brain states.
      The brain synchronizes with Binaural Beats, so the thought is that by synchronizing the brain to these waves, we can encourage similar brain states.
      When successful, they may offer some help with pain relief, stress relief, focus, creativity, etc.
