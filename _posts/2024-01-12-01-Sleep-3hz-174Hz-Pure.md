This is a replica of a study that showed success using 3Hz (Delta Wave) Binaural Beats with a 174Hz carrier tone (the deepest "healing" Solfeggio frequency) to improve sleep quality. The results showed significant improvements in both the quality of sleep (deeper sleep, less awakenings) and also post-sleep mood assessments.

See the reference below for more details, but this version is a replica of the audio used in that study (90 minutes of 3Hz Binaural Beats created by playing 174Hz in the left ear and 177Hz in the right ear). Just listen to these Binaural Beats before bed, while laying down and relaxing, with your eyes closed, and the lights turned out. The 90 minute length allows the beats to synchronize the brain for the first sleep cycle and then get out of the way.

AUTO-PLAY:  It's probably best to turn off auto-play to minimize disruption once you fall asleep.

MID-ROLL ADS:  YouTube will not allow me to disable mid-roll ads until I have enough subscribers. Please SUBSCRIBE to help me control this. I'm disabling mid-roll ads as soon as they'll allow me. In the meantime, only YouTube Premium subscribers will be able to watch without the risk of being disrupted by mid-roll ads. 

Please remember to SUBSCRIBE so I can disable mid-roll ads.

𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐒 :
1. DO NOT LISTEN to these or any other Binaural Beats when driving, operating machinery, or performing any task that requires your full focus and attention. They affect everyone differently and can induce a meditative state in some people.
2. SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE before listening to these or any other Binaural Beats if you have any conditions that may be triggered in some way (e.g., Epileptic, Seizures, Pregnant, Pacemaker, Mind Altering Drugs).
3. LISTEN AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL so you don't cause ear damage. Louder volume does not increase the effectiveness of brain entrainment.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To replicate the experiment from the pilot study, listen to the whole 90 minutes while relaxing and falling asleep.
5. For this experiment, it's best to turn off auto-play to minimize disruptions after you fall asleep. There is a chance that YouTube will play mid-roll ads, but see the comment above, I cannot disable them until I have enough subscribers. So please SUBSCRIBE to help me disable them.
