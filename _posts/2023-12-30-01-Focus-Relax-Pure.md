Helps get the brain into a focused state first (40hz) and then progressively transitions into a relaxed state (6Hz). It's a great way to start the day or to reduce stress and anxiety when preparing for something that requires focus (tests, exams, studying, bills, paperwork).

This was inspired by experiments that have had success reducing stress and anxiety using Binaural Beats of 40Hz, 10Hz, or 6Hz for only 5 minutes. Other research has found that 40Hz beats for 5-10 minutes helps to increase focus.

The brain needs at least 5 minutes to synchronize, so listen to the entire program, or enable looping to play it longer.

PURE TONES: This version contains only pure tones, which provide clean binaural beats for optimal brain entrainment. If you prefer a version with light music and ambient waves, which some prefer to help distract the brain, see the alternate version below.

𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐒 :
1. DO NOT LISTEN to these or any other Binaural Beats when driving, operating machinery, or performing any task that requires your full focus and attention. They affect everyone a little differently and can help induce a meditative state in some people.
2. SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE before listening to these or any other Binaural Beats if you have any conditions that may be triggered in some way (e.g., Epileptic, Seizures, Pregnant, Pacemaker, Mind Altering Drugs).
3. LISTEN AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL so you don't cause ear damage. Louder volume does not increase the effectiveness of brain entrainment.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation is even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to feel the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To get the most benefit, listen to the entire program because it takes time for the brain to synchronize. Most have unique progressions of carrier tones and beat progressions.

A skeptical systematic review, but I like this paper because the author presents the background very well and refers to several interesting studies.
