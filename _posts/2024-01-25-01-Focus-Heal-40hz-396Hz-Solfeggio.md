The 40Hz Solfeggio series combines the science of 40Hz Binaural Beats with the magic of Solfeggio frequencies. Studies show that 40Hz binaural beats can improve focus and concentration. Also, many people enjoy Solfeggio tones because they believe the frequencies have various healing properties. By combining them, these tracks contain two powerful sound therapies packed into one.

The brain needs at least 5 minutes to synchronize, and each video in this series is under 8 minutes to help avoid mid-roll ads, so listen to the entire program, or enable looping to play it longer.

The best way to use them, especially when studying or learning, is to listen long enough to synchronize your brain and then stop (or switch to noise) and focus on the activity that requires your attention.

Two albums are available on all major music streaming services: Focus & Heal: 40Hz Binaural Beats with Solfeggio Healing Tones. The original edition has nine (9) eighteen (18) minute tracks, each using a specific Solfeggio tone to create a 40Hz Binaural Beat. The "Half & Half" edition starts the same way, but then transition to a pure Solfeggio tone (with no Binaural Beats) after the first nine (9) minutes.

Use the playlist to see all (9) Solfeggio frequency tracks:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To get the most benefit, listen to the entire program because it takes time for the brain to synchronize.
5. For longer sessions, you can LOOP the video. On a browser, right click on the video and select "Loop" in the overlay that pops up. On mobile, touch the gear icon for the video, then select "Additional Settings" and toggle on the "Loop" setting.
