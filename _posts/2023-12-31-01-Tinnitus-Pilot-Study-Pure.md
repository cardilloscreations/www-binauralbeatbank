This is a replica of a pilot study that showed success using Binaural Beats to improve tinnitus symptoms. I am using this myself to see if it helps or cures my intermittent tinnitus, and I invite you to experiment as well and see if it helps.

Keep in mind that this is a replica of an experiment based on a pilot study that was published in early 2023. While the pilot study was very promising, more research is required. Also, keep in mind that it requires repeated exposure over a long period and is not likely to provide immediate relief.

See the reference link below for more details, but the pilot study required listening to these specific Binaural Beats for 2 hours per day, broken up into 15-minute sessions, for at least 30 days.

I've replicated the exact audio that is described in the study using pure tones (10Hz Binaural Beats created by playing 410Hz in the left ear and 400Hz in the right ear).

𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To replicate the experiment from the pilot study, listen to the whole 15 minutes, at least 4 times a day (for one hour), or 8 times a day (for two hours), and continue for at least 30 days.
5. For longer sessions, you can LOOP the video. On a browser, right click on the video and select "Loop" in the overlay that pops up. On mobile, touch the gear icon for the video, then select "Additional Settings" and toggle on the "Loop" setting.
