Sleep with the comfort of familiar voices and laughs from The Beverly Hillbillies, enhanced using special techniques that scientific studies have shown to improve sleep quality.

Psychologists suggest people enjoy falling asleep to sitcoms because it can provide a sense of comfort to hear familiar voices and laughter, but exposure to blue light from the display can be bad for sleep. So these "Sitcom Sleepers™" use a red light filter. The red light can help produce more melatonin, or at least not inhibit melatonin like blue light does.

These "Sitcom Sleepers™" also adjust the audio across all clips in the mix to help reduce peaks and normalize the volume. This allows you to set a volume that's comfortable for the entire session instead of each clip playing at a different level and disrupting your sleep.

Finally, studies have shown that a 3Hz binaural beat over a 174Hz carrier tone, played for 90 minutes each night, can improve sleep quality. So these mixes add that binaural beat in the background and have 110 minutes max length. They complete within the first sleep cycle and then don't disturb the rest of your sleep.

See the [@SitcomSleepers](https://www.youtube.com/@SitcomSleepers) channel for an alternate version without Binaural Beats (better for watching on television or if the Binaural Beats bother you).

Those who want a longer session can use the playlist instead.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐒 :
1. DO NOT LISTEN to these or any other Binaural Beats when driving, operating machinery, or performing any task that requires your full focus and attention. They affect everyone differently and can induce a meditative state in some people.
2. SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE before listening to these or any other Binaural Beats if you have any conditions that may be triggered in some way (e.g., Epileptic, Seizures, Pregnant, Pacemaker, Mind Altering Drugs).
3. LISTEN AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL so you don't cause ear damage. Louder volume does not increase the effectiveness of brain entrainment.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. To benefit from the binaural beats, use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Listen at a comfortable level that will not disrupt your sleep. Some episodes have music or sudden noises that still come through, and you don't want those sounds to wake you up.
3. Each mix is just long enough to help you fall asleep, and then get out of the way, so you can continue to sleep without disruption. If you prefer a longer session, use the playlist instead.
