Gets the brain into a focused state first (40hz) and then progressively transitions into a relaxed state (6Hz). This is a great way to start your day, enhance your meditation, or simply reduce stress and anxiety when preparing for something that requires focus (tests, exams, studying, bills, paperwork).

This was inspired by experiments that have had success reducing stress and anxiety using Binaural Beats of 40Hz and 6Hz for only 5 minutes. Other research has found that 40Hz beats for 5-10 minutes helps to increase focus.

Listen to the entire track because your brain needs at least 5 minutes to synchronize. The length is just under 8 minutes, to AVOID mid-roll ad disruptions. See instructions below to enable looping if you want to play it longer.

PURE TONES: This version contains only pure tones, which provide clean binaural beats for optimal brain entrainment. If you prefer a version with light music and ambient waves, which some prefer to help distract the brain, see the alternate version below.

𝐈𝐍𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 :
1. Use decent quality stereo headphones and make sure they are in the correct ears (left and right). Headphones with noise isolation are even better.
2. Only turn the volume up enough to hear the pulsing or wobbling effect of the Binaural Beat. Louder isn't better and only risks damaging your hearing.
3. When trying to meditate or relax with the beats, close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Focus on the sound and let it take you away.
4. To get the most benefit, listen to the entire program because it takes time for the brain to synchronize. This track has a unique progression of carrier tones and beats.

A skeptical systematic review, but I like this paper because the author presents the background very well and refers to several interesting studies.
